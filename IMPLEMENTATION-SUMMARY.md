## Technical Details

### Field Specifications
```html
<select id="experience" name="experience" required>
  <option value="">Select...</option>
  <option value="beginner">Beginner (Just getting started)</option>
  <option value="intermediate">Intermediate (Built some projects)</option>
  <option value="advanced">Experienced developer)</option>
</select>
```

### Database Value Options
When adding to Cloudflare D1 (future):
```sql
experience TEXT CHECK(experience IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'))
```

### API Request Format
```javascript
POST /api/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string (email format)",
  "university": "string",
  "year": "string",
  "major": "string (optional)",
  "experience": "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",  ← NEW
  "dietary": "string (optional)",
  "tshirt": "string",
  "coc": boolean,
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Email in Development:**
   - MailChannels returns 401 (no API credentials)
   - Not an issue - backup logging captures all data
   - Will work in production with env vars

2. **No Database Storage:**
   - Currently saves via email + console logs
   - Future: Add Cloudflare D1 integration
   - See SIGNUP-IMPLEMENTATION.md for D1 setup guide
